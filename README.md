# verilog-beginner-to-intermediate-lab
Verilog-based digital design and simulation projects from my 4th semester EDA lab. Includes adders, subtractors, multipliers, registers, and more.


# Verilog EDA Lab – 4th Semester

This repository contains Verilog-based hardware design and simulation projects completed as part of my 4th semester Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Lab coursework.

## 🔧 Topics Implemented

- Half Adder and Full Adder
- Half Subtractor and Full Subtractor
- 8-bit Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier, Divider
- 8-bit Register
- Basic Arithmetic and Logic Circuits
- Testbenches for simulation

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/user/809060) – Cloud-based simulation
- Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language)
- Some projects also written in VHDL/SystemVerilog

## 📌 Objective

The objective of these projects is to gain practical exposure to digital logic design using Verilog, simulate testbenches, and understand timing, structure, and functionality of digital circuits.
- To develop a strong foundation in digital logic design using Verilog HDL.
- To implement, simulate, and verify common combinational and sequential circuits such as adders, subtractors, multiplexers, registers, and ALUs.
- To understand testbench creation and simulation workflows using EDA Playground.
- To bridge the gap between theoretical digital design concepts and their practical implementation in hardware description languages.
- To build industry-relevant HDL coding habits by practicing modular and testable design patterns.
- To prepare for advanced topics like FPGA development, computer architecture, and digital system design through foundational Verilog practice.
- To document and showcase academic lab work as a professional open-source portfolio for internships and future opportunities.
